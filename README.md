# Keneth-Martin-Rotation-Frankfurt-I-Swift
One of Kenneth Martin's Works recreated and Animated in SwiftUI.
Created for the AP-CSP classroom dedicated to Sedat Yalcin.


Recipe
Draw a Path: Start by creating a path. You will gradually build this path step by step.

Edit Colors: Define the colors for your line from your assets.

Edit Length: Calculate the slope of your line using path.move and path.addLine to determine the starting and ending points of the line.

Edit Animation: Create an animation with a duration of 2 seconds using the trim function. This animation will automatically reveal the line when a button is pressed.

To find the coordinates for the start and end points (S and T), you used an online tool called Geogebra, which helps determine the distance between points. The link you provided likely contains a visual representation of how you calculated these points using Geogebra.
